# BWSI-Medlytics
This is a new repository to be used for the BWSI Medlytics Program. This repository was used during the summer of 2018 to store data relating to atrial fibrillation (heart arryhythmias in general) of patients from multiple hospitals. Data acquired from PhysioNet (https://physionet.org/). This data set is one

Training data has been separated from validation (and testing) data within this repo. Quantities of each set of data can be viewed here. Each identification number on each file represents one patient. Therefore, there is one .mat and one .hea file for each patient in the data collection. The .hea file contains the data in a format similar to .csv, which will be the necessary input for the algorithm.

Executive summary of project: the data from PhysioNet will be used to build a machine learning algorithm (likely a convolutional neural net) to predict whether a patient has afib (or another heart arryhthmia) based on the ECG measured. Main discrepancy to account for: patient ECG data for testing/demo purposes will be taken with Neulog sensors, not ECG machines, like the ones used to collect the data. However, it is important to note that, in application, actual ECG machines in hospitals would be used to make these diagnoses.
