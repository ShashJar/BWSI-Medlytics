# BWSI-Medlytics
This is a new repository to be used for the BWSI Medlytics Program. This repository was used during the summer of 2018 to store data relating to atrial fibrillation (heart arryhythmias in general) of patients from multiple hospitals. Data acquired from PhysioNet (https://physionet.org/).

Training data has been separated from validation (and testing) data within this repo. Quantities of each set of data can be viewed here.
